# Weather App in SvelteKit

<h5>This is a weather app that I created using svelteKit.</h5>
It all started as a side project. It initially was created using only sveltejs, but soon I found using API keys pretty inconvenient, and I found myself having to go waaay outta my way to implement it in a frankly jank way. And anyway, I learnt 3 new technologies in that version of the project; So you can imagine just how messy the code got.

This new implementation serves as a way for me to learn svelteKit as well as to write my code in a better way.
